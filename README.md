## fancyNeural
A neural net with the sole purpose of looking good.

This program starts with 4 sensory, 4 motor, 392 identical interneurons and it has to figure out the ideal interneuron weights to go towards it's food by evolving.

* It has no benefit over more widely used neural alghorithms
* It is unoptimized
* It is a work in progress never to be finished
* This problem didn't need a neural network in the first place

But...

* It looks cool
* It is interactive!
